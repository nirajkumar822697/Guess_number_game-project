🎯 Guess the Number Game (Python)

This is a simple Guess the Number Game built using Python.
The game uses the random library and conditional statements.

In this game, the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 50, and the user has 5 chances to guess it correctly.

🕹️ How the Game Works

The computer generates a random number between 1 to 50.

The player gets maximum 5 attempts.

On each guess:

✔️ If the guessed number is greater than the computer number:
👉 Hint: "Please think a smaller number"

✔️ If the guessed number is smaller than the computer number:
👉 Hint: "Please think a bigger number"

✔️ If the guessed number is correct:
👉 Message: "Congratulations! You guessed it right!"

✔️ If the guessed number is greater than 50:
👉 Message: "Out of Range! Please enter a number between 1 to 50"
👉 (This does not reduce chances)

If the user fails to guess in 5 attempts:
👉 Game Over message is shown.
